# Game Review for (NUMINA)

## Details

### Rating
I am using a 1 - 10 rating system with 10 being the best. For this game I am giving it an 8. For the purposes of test, this games opening was way too long, making it difficult to get to the core mechanics without taking a very long time to dive into it.

## Summary
This game is about a character that is trying to traverse the world to find a cure for his sister. During his travels he is able to hear a voice, which is the player. Through his interactions with the player he is able to get help making choices to complete his tasks and the games puzzles. One of the biggest features for this game is its interactivity with the player and the game characters, making them feel connected in more ways than just using some controls to move a character.

The game is built like the old SNES final fantasy style games. The graphics are also akin to that era but with more modern methods for animating and integrating sprites. Music and UI audio was very nice and did not distract or overpower the rest of the game, which is easy to do.

All of the standard features for an RPG are here. There are characters for making a party, leveling characters through fighting monsters and npc encounters, as well as skills and equipment. Having a standard set of features as a core for this game made it easier to see the 'breaking the 4th wall' feature for what it was instead of it being lost in a myriad of other 'new' features. Monster and NPC encounters were pretty standard as well, nothing new there.

## Final Thoughts
Being able to save the games progress at anytime was a good feature. Since this game is like older SNES RPG games, which usually had a save ability that was limited to certain locations, being able to save at any point was very nice. As for dislikes, it was just that the opening was very long with very minimal interactivity. I was only able to press the continue dialogue buttons, nothing else. This made it hard to get into since it felt more like a slow movie versus a game.
