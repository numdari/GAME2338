### Rating
I rate games on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the best. Six Dice Game is going to get two ratings. The first is in regards to game play - 8. The game is simplistic and easy to learn as well as good controls. Overall rating, 5. The reason the game has an overall lower rating is because of the Ads. The levels are too shorts and then you are watching two ads before you are allowed to play again.

## Summary
This game is about matching dice blocks that are that same color to eliminate them for points. The more consecutive dice you connect the more points you get. You are allowed to connect the dice in any of the 8 directions, giving you a lot of options, should there be enough dice to connect. The possible strategic methods mixed with the fast paced, timed levels made this funner for me than other match games.
This game does not have any sort of story or much to work to unlock. I find that no story makes it stay true to its roots of just a basic game. I would have liked to have seen some sort of achievement system or options you could unlock. The only thing I could see as a possiblity is a different set of dice to use for game play but I did not get that far to see if it was actually an option.
A very simplistic game, as it should be for a match game. The audio was alright but I usually play phone games with it off. There was two detracting factors for me: ads and short levels/play time. While I understand that a 'free' game isn't really free, having more ads in the game versus actual play time is insane. I do not see how someone thinks it is ok to make your customer sit through 2 ads, maybe 3, after every level. Let alone, the levels are really, really short. By the time you start feeling like you are playing a game, its over.

## Final Thoughts
The feature I liked the most was just playing the game. Being able to match the dice up in whatever order I deemed, whether that was the most or least efficient method, was nice. It brought about a little bit of strategy to the genre. I disliked both the ads and the small amount of actual play time allowed. Over all the lack of feeling like I get to 'play' the game versus just watching all their ads, has turned me off from wanting to continue playing the game.
