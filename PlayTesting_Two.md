**Question:** During your playtesting were the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ The rules were clearly defined and updated each level. After so many stages a new rule or method of play was introduced and an example was given on how to use the method or playstyle. 

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ The "area for creating your own house" could be removed and wouldn't affect gameplay. This area was just a means by which to collect achievements and spend them on a look for the house you couldn't actually go into.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ This game is strategy based with no hint of pressure from time to make your actions speedy. So in this way the game is balanced towards making more strategic moves to achieve the levels goal in a cost effective manor (you only have so many moves you can make for each level).

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ From my standpoint, the timing of the game is easy going and fits the nature of the game. It would have been nice to see a play mode where the goal was to get as far as you can within a time limit, something like tetris but with this games bubbles.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ The mechanics and theme definitely go together. As this is the third installment of the game series, the creators have refined the look and style to be their own and still retain the basic bubble pop game style. What I find to be nice is the mechanics introduced, after a few levels, that increase the complexity of the game but still match the theme.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ I actually had alot of fun playing this game. While I can see some randomization within which colors of the bubbles are spawning, each level has their own specific puzzle to it. How you decide to attack that puzzle determines your score or if you even pass the level. I like puzzle/strategy games.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ The only issue I can think of is in the afore mentioned randomization of the bubble colors. Some levels were really hard the first time around and then the second time was way easier due to how the colors lined up on initial level creation. This algorithm might need to be tweaked so that the difficulty of a particular level doesnt get too hard/easy just from the bubble spawning.
