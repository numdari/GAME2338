# Game Review for (METRO 2033 REDUX)

## Details

### Metro 2033 Redux
The name of the game, subtitle, and the url or information on how to find the game.

### Rating
From 1 - 10, 10 being the best, I find this game to be about a 7. Holisticly speaking this game was complete and did work. My issue was with the controls being limited at some times and then totally free at others. This made it hard to figure out what was going on and how to respond to the situations. Audio was good and so were the graphics. If the controls were not an issue at times, I would have given this game a 9.

## Summary
The game is about living in the subway tunnels below Moscow, Russian in a post apocolyptic era. I am not sure if it was because of aliens or nuclear fallout but the surface is contaminated. Because of this, the game has a bit of a survivalist aspect forcing you to watch your air filter and bullets.

Metro has a feature where you can attack the NPC's, even the core ones that are apart of the storyline. I am not sure how well you can progress if you kill anyone, but I do know that will find it hard to survive since everyone will be after you.

This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
