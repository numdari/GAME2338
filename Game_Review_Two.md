### Rating
From 1 - 10, 10 being the best, I find this game to be about a 7. Holisticly speaking this game was complete and did work. My issue was with the controls being limited at some times and then totally free at others. This made it hard to figure out what was going on and how to respond to the situations. Audio was good and so were the graphics. If the controls were not an issue at times, I would have given this game a 9.

## Summary
The game is about living in the subway tunnels below Moscow, Russian in a post apocolyptic era. I am not sure if it was because of aliens or nuclear fallout but the surface is contaminated. Because of this, the game has a bit of a survivalist aspect forcing you to watch your air filter and bullets.

Metro has a feature where you can attack the NPC's, even the core ones that are apart of the storyline. I am not sure how well you can progress if you kill anyone, but I do know that you will find it hard to survive since everyone will be after you. Another feature is that currency is high calibur bullets, like armor piercing bullets. While this is not unique in its self, it made more sense to the storyline than using paper money from a government that no longer exists.

Generally speaking, the movement controls were pretty standard for an FPS game. This made the usablilty pretty high... until they started locking said controls to suit their scenarios. Playing within mostly tunnels was a bit limiting as well. Though later down the line you are able to explore some building like structures, mostly you play within the confines of the subway systems. This is fine for the story, not so much for an FPS standpoint as you are almost always just staring at walls.

## Final Thoughts
I liked the FPS aspect of the game, being able to immerse your self into the story and feel like you are the character. The problem, as mentioned above, was that at times your controls were locked to a certain turn radius. This made it very diffult to manuever. At other times you had free reign. While not a bad thing, there was no indicator as to which mode you were in so time was wasted trying to do things you just were not allowed to do.
