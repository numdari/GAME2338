### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest. For this game I would like to rate it about 8. For the most part there was no actual action, nothing to run from or kill, so the tediousness of the games main task became more apparent. This is not exactly a bad thing though because this is a niche game and thus should be held to different standards than an, say, FPS.

## Summary
This game has the player playing the part of a janitor. Your job is to go to jobsites that have been messed up for various reasons and clean them. You are scored for how cleanly you are and how well you let your inner OCD freak out. Do not be fooled by the generic description I have given as the jobsites are anything but ordinary. At each site something has gone wrong: an alien experiment got loose and killed all the employees, a security bug set off all the automated defenses and killed all the personel, and in the Vulcan Affair a secret agent killed all the badguys in an evil lair, leaving you to clean it up.

All of the games assets are governed by physics, meaning that you will knock things around if you bump into them, drop them off ledges, crash into walls. Unlike in Skyrim where you can move object by picking them up but with some difficulty, this game has you being able to adjust the orientation of the object you are holding before placing it. I found this feature to be very easy to use and so helpful compared to other games. Movement controls were standard for a first person game, which made it very easy to just pick up and go. What was not made apparent was the actually controls over all. There is no tutorial or anything in the UI that states, while playing, that you should press this, or do that. This lead to some frustration for a little bit when I wanted to interact with the game world. Overall the game is geared towards an older audience and as such they treat you like an adult, so no complaints here.

The theme of the game, to me, was very original and while dark and gruesome, humorous as well. The story elements are each based solely on the level you are playing. So each is their own self contained world. You are scored based on how well you clean the environment but also how well you do at not poking around at all the confidential material of the client. This makes it entriguing while at the same time you have to hold yourself back in order to maximize your final score. Since the levels are one offs, you can easily replay a level without affecting some grand scheme. And, since you probably are not able to keep from looking where you shouldn't the first time you play, this gives each level a certain amount of replayability as well.

## Final Thoughts
All in all I really enjoyed playing this game, especially the Vulcan Affair DLC with its laser mounted sharks in the swimming pool. While the idea of cleaning if usually a pretty daunting task to most people, this game made it sort of fun. Out of all the game features and mechanics, I found that the repair tool (for fixing bullet holes in walls) was my least favorite. The concept that you can just blast the wall to fix it was funny, until you found that the ability to aim the cannon and subsequently actually fix anything with it was lacking. This wasn't a completely bad thing as it was pretty funny to see the well get more messed up than it already was.
