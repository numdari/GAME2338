### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 10, 10 being the best. I give this game somewhere between 9 and 10. Personally the only detracting features were mostly my inability to go pro.

## Summary
Gran Turismo is about all things racing using a realistic physics engine. There various game modes that will allow you to race to your hearts content as well as leisurely to show off your cars. The controls are easy to use and respond very well and fast to the users input. Seeing how this is a physics based driving game, just knowing the controls wont help you win. You need to master your cars and learn advanced manuevers in order to get an edge over the competition.

Within the various game modes you are able to traverse over 100 different tracks - spanning various locations all over the world. These game modes will allow you to race for cash and prizes, working your way through the racing curcuit. Being able to make it to the top will truely test your skills at driving as well as customizing your rides.

One of the more awesome features, in my eyes, is being able to buy and customize/upgrade over 700 different vehicles. To me, this is an insane number of cars! Take into account that each of them has their own stats, realisticly so, that will be taken into account when you take them on the tracks. You race, make money, buy and upgrade your cars... Race some more! All in all, Gran Turismo is fun game but it takes skill to master.

## Final Thoughts
The feature I like the most was the physics based driving engine. Being able to modify your vehicles and have those modifications truely affect how the car reacts and moves - because of more torque, less weight, more grip - was seriously awesome to be. I do not play racing games much, and while it is fun to just race around in crazy vehicles, I find that realistic mechanics are more my style. This being said, I also find this to be the feature I dislike the most. With the customizations available being numerous and how they can affect your ability to control your vehicle, I found it very hard to get the right balance to fit my gameplay style. It was even harder to find that balance and be able to win!
