### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 10, 10 being the best. I give this game somewhere between 9 and 10. Personally the only detracting features were mostly my inability to go pro.

## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

## Final Thoughts
The feature I like the most was the physics based driving engine. Being able to modify your vehicles and have those modifications truely affect how the car reacts and moves - because of more torque, less weight, more grip - was seriously awesome to be. I do not play racing games much, and while it is fun to just race around in crazy vehicles, I find that realistic mechanics are more my style. This being said, I also find this to be the feature I dislike the most. With the customizations available being numerous and how they can affect your ability to control your vehicle, I found it very hard to get the right balance to fit my gameplay style. It was even harder to find that balance and be able to win!
