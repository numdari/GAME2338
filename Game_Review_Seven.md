### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 10, 10 being the best. For Yu-Gi-Oh!Dragon Quest Builders I would give it a decent 8.

## Summary
Dragon Quest Builders is about the Main Character needing to rebuild the world before the last light rays disappear. The main objective is to rebuild humanity starting from the shacks you wake up near. You have to fights monsters and hunt down materials to craft components to build walls and doors. You do this to protect your citizens and provide cover from the monsters.

I enjoyed wondering around the world looking for secret areas and hard to find materials. In general I love crafting in games and Dragon Quest Builders is based mainly around gathering and crafting, so I had a lot of fun. 

The controls were pretty standard and easy to use. What I did find frustrating was when you build rooms with ceilings and then go inside, the camera will have clipping issues with the walls until you rotate the camera a bit to reset it. After that you will able to see around the room just fine. While this was frustrating, it was not a game breaking aspect and truthfully it only happened on structures you created, not ones that were pre-built.

## Final Thoughts
Even though I dislike the way the camera gets clipped by the geometry when entering rooms, the rest of the game is enjoyable. The story went along with the building aspect, making the game play and crafting seemless and codependant of each other. I found this to be very entriquing and I would definitely recommending this game to others.
