# GAME TESTING CONCEPTS

## Testing Steps Taken

Bungie took any steps to when they were testing Halo 3. Some of the steps that I could decern are listed below.

Morning testing - For the first few hours of the day they test the build that was produced the night before. They test all the new features, old features, and stability overall of the game. Anything that is not working as intended gets documented into various bug reports and sent back to the developers.

Integration testing - Every new item added to the game or feature that has even the slightest modification gets tested over and over again. Even if they have already performed the tests before with that particular item or feature, they do it again. As stated a few times during the videos, even one line of code changed has the potential to break the game.

Playtesting - Groups of people are brought in to play the game. While these people are playing the test group is getting feedback as well as watching how the players are actually playing their game. "Is it evident that the objective is this?" "Is this encounter too long?". So while the game is not breaking, the actual game play might not be intuitive or working as intended.

Balance testing - A lot of effort is put into making sure that all the weapons and vehicles are working correctly. That the micro changes being made do not destroy the balance during multiplayer. During one mission they were having difficulty making a jump with a vehicle, so they wanted to increase that vehicles' speed by 1mph. They had to test that this change did not destroy the game or any of the other game play for where that vehicle exists.

UI Testing - Just making sure that any graphical interface they implement is in fact interactable as well as works like it is intended. Also that the visuals, like for selecting the color for the character, is working and visually appealing.

Usability Testing - For Bungie, they work with Microsoft to do testing from regular players. They have psychologists that right up profiles for the players that later get used to analyze the playstyle and levels/equipment.

Before shipping, Bungie does triage to figure out what sort of bugs that they know about they have need to fix NOW or can be done later in a patch.

Overall, to Bungie, you can never test enough.
