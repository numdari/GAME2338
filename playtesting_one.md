**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ The rules were clearly defined - both in how you win each level and lose each level. You win by defending 

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ The game was straightforward and I did not see anything that could be taken out in the UI or basic design. Some of the creatures were redundant and thus, for me, detracted from the originality of the game theme.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ The game is geared towards Everyone. The controls are easy and the story/theme are plain and direct. The only problem with the balance is that the difficulty ramps up a little too quickly for younger kids. To combat this you would need to farm the lower levels to get enough funds to buy ammunition for the higher levels. This is not something the younger impatient kids are used to. So I would probably say that this should be labeled for 10+.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ Your answer here

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ Your answer here

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ I did have some fun playing this game. I found that I was slightly annoyed with how the targeting of the creatures was too specific, but it did not actually detract from the game.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ I did not find any issues with the game - other than my own preference for the targeting/aiming at creatures. It was clearly defined that the targeting was that way so I can not classify that as a bug/issue. Management of your own resources is also not an "issue" so while some levels were really difficult without ammunition for certain guns, again this is an intended design.
