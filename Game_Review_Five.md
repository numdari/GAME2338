## Details

### Game Title
Yu-Gi-Oh! https://www.yugioh.com/

### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 10, 10 being the best. For Yu-Gi-Oh! I would give it a solid 9. Just because I have issues with the direction they took the newer content does not affect the awesomeness of playing the game.

## Summary
Yu-Gi-Oh! is about using the cards you are dealt, from a deck you put together yourself, to deplete your opponents life points. You have multiple tools at your desposal to either boost your summons attack/defense, reduce your opponents summons' attack/defense, or attack your opponent directly. Strategy plays a huge part, as well as luck. Depending on your overall deck makeup and how you play the cards you are dealt can greatly affect the outcome of the game. Because there are more than just monster cards available to you, the overall gameplay of any given match can be vastly different from the last match.

The cards you are able to use depends on your inventory, which decks you are purchasing from, as well as you luck since there are rarity of cards with varying levels of availability. There are basic monster cards, no matter the rarity, are just that, basic. These cards comprise the majority of the early decks card base. These do nothing but supply you with easy to use summons. Then there are Effect cards. These are monsters that give can effect when they are flipped face up or summoned. Magic cards are cards that provide an affect to either a summoned monsters, the fields as a whole, or just the player. Next is the trap card. This card is a card you lay face down and only use it when you want to sneak attack the other player based on the trap cards' activation requirements. Depending on how you use trap cards, you can vastly change the tide of the game. Lastly is Fusion/Combo type cards. These are monsters that need you to sacrafice a certain number or strength of monster in order to summon them. There are various methods for summoning these types of creatures and over the years the methods have increased in number.

The cards artwork and background stories were originally based off of ancient eqypt. Over the years there has been a huge push to bring about more modern and futuristic monsters and combination summons. On a personal level I think the 'ancient' factor should have been explored a lot more. Instead of futuristic I think they should have looked into using other ancient cultures and they mythology. Since the story revolving around the creation of the cards and the mythical objects they were summoned to obtain or defend was based on ancient egypt, it seems more feasible to go to ancient rome or greek or even atlantis. The reason for moving to futuristic was to keep the younger crowds interested in still playing and watching the Yu-Gi-Oh! series. I just found this a turn off to the game and stopped playing and buying cards long ago. Since Yu-Gi-Oh! has been running strong here in America for about 19 years, I can't blame them for trying to keep it fresh and still attract a younger crowd.

## Final Thoughts
Yu-Gi-Oh! is an addicting and competitive card game. My wife and I would play for hours, with me trying to find graceful ways to lose so she wouldn't disown me for kicking her bum so often. I love that you get to completely build your decks the way you want. Granted you are limited by your own inventory and funds for buying new packs. This is normal for any card playing game, the chance of getting a good card mixed with having to buy multiple packs to increase your available inventory. The gameplay with simple enough to understand but then gets complicated when you start introducing the magic/trap cards. No single card with exactly the same as another when it comes to the effects they provide. This is very intriguing to me. The turn off for me was the direction of the story and subsequiently the artwork/playstyle that the company took a few years back. This does not detract from the gameplay so much as just my interest in continuing to play the game.
